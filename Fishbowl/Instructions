Instructions:

1. Divide into two teams.
2. Run the Play_Fishbowl.py program to generate your hand of cards.
3. A person from one team has 60 seconds to get the other team to guess as many card names from their screen as possible.
    (a) Skipping is allowed!
    (b) The person on the 'describing' team who isn't talking needs to keep track of cards guessed correctly so points can be tallied at the end.
    (c) Points from each round go the guessers.
4. Round 1: You can use any words, sounds or gestures except the name of the card.
4. Round 2: Use one word only - NOT the name on the card.
5. Round 3: Charades only - sound effects are allowed!
